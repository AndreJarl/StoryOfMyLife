              As a child, I was full of energy and curiosity, always eager to explore the world around me.

              At first, I carried over my carefree and curious nature from elementary, often prioritizing fun over studies.
               However, as the years went by, I started to realize the importance of discipline and hard work.

              <p class="subtitle">Entering college was a whole new chapter in my lifeâ€”one filled with excitement, challenges, and growth. Unlike my earlier years, I quickly realized that college required more discipline, responsibility, and perseverance. It was no longer just about passing exams but about truly understanding my field and preparing for my future.

As an aspiring computer engineer, I immersed myself in coding, projects, and hands-on experiences that tested both my knowledge and creativity. There were late nights, tough deadlines, and moments of doubt, but each obstacle only pushed me to work harder.
